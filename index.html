                <li>Physics is a natural science based on experiments, measurements and mathematical 
                    analysis with the purpose of finding quantitative physical laws for everything from 
                    the nanoworld of the microcosmos to the planets, solar systems and galaxies that occupy the macrocosmos.
                </li>
                <li>he word "physics" comes from Ancient Greek: φυσική (ἐπιστήμη), romanized: physikḗ (epistḗmē), meaning "knowledge of nature"</li>
                <li>Modern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max Planck in quantum theory and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations. Classical mechanics predicted a varying speed of light, which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism; this discrepancy was corrected by Einstein's theory of special relativity, which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light.</li>

                <ul>
                <li>Chemistry is the study of matter, its properties, how and why substances combine or separate to form other substances, and how substances interact 
                    with energy. ... Chemistry is part of everything in our lives. Every material in existence is made up of matter — even our own bodies.</li>
                <li>The word chemistry comes from a modification of the word alchemy, which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine.</li>
                <li>The current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model. Traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles, atoms, molecules, substances, metals, crystals and other aggregates of matter. Matter can be studied in solid, liquid, gas and plasma states, in isolation or in combination. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>The word biology is derived from the greek words /bios/ meaning /life/ and /logos/ meaning /study/ and 
                    is defined as the science of life and living organisms. An organism is a living entity consisting of 
                    one cell e.g. bacteria, or several cells e.g. animals, plants and fungi.</li>
                <li>Biology derives from the Ancient Greek words of βίος romanized bíos meaning 'life' and -λογία; romanized -logía meaning 'branch of study' or 'to speak'.Those combined make the Greek word βιολογία romanized biología meaning 'biology'. </li>
                <li>The Modern Biology course covers specialized and somewhat advanced topics in the fields of cellular biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics. It does not cover organismal biology or taxonomy.</li>
