                <p>Physics is a natural science based on experiments, measurements and mathematical 
                    analysis with the purpose of finding quantitative physical laws for everything from 
                    the nanoworld of the microcosmos to the planets, solar systems and galaxies that occupy the macrocosmos.

                <p>Chemistry is the study of matter, its properties, how and why substances combine or separate to form other substances, and how substances interact 
                    with energy. ... Chemistry is part of everything in our lives. Every material in existence is made up of matter â€” even our own bodies.</p>

                <p>The word biology is derived from the greek words /bios/ meaning /life/ and /logos/ meaning /study/ and 
                    is defined as the science of life and living organisms. An organism is a living entity consisting of 
                    one cell e.g. bacteria, or several cells e.g. animals, plants and fungi.</p>
